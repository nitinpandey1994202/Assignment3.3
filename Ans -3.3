QUE. List the components of Hadoop 2.x and explain them in detail.
ANS:-
  As we know hadoop 2.x is the extension of the hadoop 1.x because 1.x had the certain limitations such as no. of machine,
  metadata problem.
There are 3 major components of Hadoop:
1)HDFS
2)YARN
3)MapReduce

:::How Hadoop 2.x Major Components Works

Hadoop 2.x components follow some architecture to interact each other and
to work parallel in a reliable, highly available and fault-tolerant manner.
1)  All Master Nodes and Slave Nodes contains both MapReduce and HDFS Components.
2)  One Master Node has two components:
      1)Resource Manager(YARN or MapReduce v2)
      2)HDFS
It’s HDFS component is also knows as NameNode. It’s NameNode is used to store Meta Data.

2) In Hadoop 2.x, some more Nodes acts as Master Nodes.Master Node has 3 components:
       1)Node Manager
       2)Application Master
       3)Data Node
These Slave Nodes have two components:
         1)Node Manager
         2)HDFS
It’s HDFS component is also knows as Data Node. It’s Data Node component is 
used to store actual our application Big Data. These nodes does not contain Application Master component.

DESCRIPTION:
1) Resource Manager:
     1)Resource Manager is a Per-Cluster Level Component.
     2)Resource Manager is again divided into two components:
                                 1)Scheduler
                                 2)Application Manager
     3)Resource Manager’s Scheduler is :
         1)Responsible to scheduler required resources to Applications (that is Per-Application Master).
         2)It does only scheduling.
         3)It does care about monitoring or tracking of those Applications.

2)Application Master:

  1)Application Master is a per-application level component. It is responsible for:
                 1)Managing assigned Application Life cycle.
                 2)It interacts with both Resource Manager’s Scheduler and Node Manager
                 3)It interacts with Scheduler to acquire required resources.
                 4)It interacts with Node Manager to execute assigned tasks and monitor those task’s status.
   :Node Manager:

           1)Node Manager is a Per-Node Level component.
           2)It is responsible for:
                       1)Managing the life-cycle of the Container.
                       2)Monitoring each Container’s Resources utilization.
IMPORTANT POINTS:
            1)Resource Manager is Per-Cluster component where as Application Master is per-application component.
            2)Both Hadoop 1.x and Hadoop 2.x Architectures follow Master-Slave Architecture Model.
